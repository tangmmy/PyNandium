**From NAND to Programs: Building a Computer in Pure Python**

PyNandium is an educational project where we construct a complete virtual computer systemâ€”from the ground upâ€”using only the `nand` logic gate as the fundamental building block.

This project is inspired by the spirit of "Nand2Tetris", but implemented entirely in Python, aiming to demonstrate how computers work at every levelâ€”from basic logic gates to running a high-level application.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- Build a working digital logic simulator starting from a `nand` gate.
- Construct:
  - Basic logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, XOR...
  - Arithmetic components: Adders, ALU...
  - Sequential components: Flip-flops, registers, RAM...
  - A CPU capable of executing a custom Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).
  - An assembler/interpreter for programs.
  - High-level programs running on the virtual machine.

## ðŸ§± Layers of Construction

1. **Logic Gates** - Built from the `nand` gate
2. **Combinational Circuits** - Adders, multiplexers, etc.
3. **Sequential Circuits** - Flip-flops, registers, counters, RAM
4. **CPU** - ALU + control unit + program counter
5. **Instruction Set Architecture** - Custom machine language
6. **Assembler** - Converts assembly to binary
7. **Virtual OS** - A basic loader, memory management, I/O
8. **Application Programs** - Programs that run on the machine

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- No external libraries required (pure Python by default)
